Title: how your data is being used 
Purpose statement: to inform my audience about the risks and possibilities of companies collecting our data 
Introduction: 
We all have used services like google and firefox to do research on our favorite topics. Not long ago consumers had to pay to use services like these which are now free for use to use. So why is it free for us to use now? That’s because these companies have found a new way to generate revenue by collecting your data.  Wired a tech blog has said that data. Data in the 21st Century is like Oil in the 18th Century: an immensely, untapped valuable asset. Like oil, for those who see Data's fundamental value and learn to extract and use it there will be huge rewards.
According to the chief computer scientist at the Electronic frontier foundation, a digital right non-profit “Facebook can learn almost anything about you by using artificial intelligence to analyze your behavior”
 Target had used its data to determine a pregnancy score for its customers. A man in Minneapolis found out his highschool daughter was pregnant through mail that was sent to his home containing ads for strollers and diapers. 
Thesis: companies are collecting data and using it in a variety of different ways 
Transition: Your here are three bigs ways your data is being used 
Body: 
Main Point 1: online browsing habits are recorded and sold to third parties 
 Amazon and other online retailers collect things such as products customers click on, items searches and how long customers spend looking at each item.
Using this information these companies serve up ads for items that customers have searched for and use this data to influence customer behavior and maximize profit margins 
Web analytic tools are used to send data to third parties so shoppers ad preferences are not only limited to the websites they currently are on visiting(privacy.net) 
Sensitive medical information that would normally be protected under hipaa has been leaked in the past 
Searching up medical symptoms gets added to your digital footprint and your illness can be very easily linked to you ( vice.com )


Transition: 

Main point : Governments around the world are using data to assess risk and determine social credit 
Governments looking into suspects and many times not even informing them 
According to data released by facebook.com. In the last year the U.S government made over 50,000 requests, those requests asked for data on 82,431 users/accounts and of those requests two thirds of them included a non disclosure prohibiting facebook from informing the user (https://transparency.facebook.com/government-data-requests)
Various governments (local up to federal) in the US have used information gained from surveillance to sabotage the efforts of groups promoting peaceful change by turning people against each other and creating suspicion among them (https://nyti.ms/2SIBKnW)


Governments such as china have already established a social score system and  are planning to use this data to determine this score (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-credit/china-to-bar-people-with-bad-social-credit-from-planes-trains-idUSKCN1GS10S)
Data has become so valuable that it is now being used as evidence in the courtroom. This includes access to prove or disprove any and all claims.


Conclusion: 
Circle back to main points 
The situation will either see personal data being treated as confidential information that cannot be accessed by outside agencies (such as personal medical data is now) or Governments will demand a sizable cut, forcing big internet companies to diversify their revenue stream in order to increase profiles: i.e. charging for “free” services.
Final remarks 
Data collection is becoming mainstream, advertisers and governments are using this to their advantage
